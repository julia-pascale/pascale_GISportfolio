This is my public portfolio for a course at Heinz, Advanced GIS, Spring 2022.
## about me
Julia Pascale (she/her): Master’s student in Public Policy and Management, Non-Profit and Public Finance concentration

Hi! I’m Julia. I am in Pittsburgh, where I have lived since I graduated from college in 2016, but I’m from New York. Before I started grad school, I worked in affordable housing for [City of Bridges Community Land Trust](cityofbridgesclt.org) for 4 years, and I’m currently also a research analyst at [Fourth Economy](fourtheconomy.com). When I am not working, I’m either playing guitar, walking my dog on the [north shore trail](https://goo.gl/maps/6XnuoYZ9URZGiA9U7), or playing guitar for my dog.

## what I hope to learn

I'm looking forward to practicing and further developing my GIS skills in this course. I like making maps and other data visualizations that look cool and help people process important information quickly. When I graduate I want to use these skills to inform advocacy and decision-making for governments and mission-based organizations.
